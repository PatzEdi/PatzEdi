Hi, Iâ€™m @PatzEdi.

My real name is Edward Ferrari.

You can visit my website here: [PatzEdi's Website](https://patzedi.github.io)

**I am really interested in software, coding, ethical hacking, and even machine learning. My repositories are made in order to improve not only my strength in these skills, but your strength as well, providing useful tools for everybody.**

If someone needs help with something, I am looking to collaborate on different projects involving python, ethical hacking, and in the near future machine learning.

Contact me at patzedigithub@gmail.com for anything!

Please feel free to star my repositories or leave comments on what I can do to improve. We are all a team here.

PatzEdi.
